# Clustering of Indonesian Districts/Cities Based on Poverty and Development Indicators

This repository contains the Python script for clustering Indonesian districts based on various socioeconomic indicators. The analysis aims to identify patterns and groups among districts/cities in terms of poverty levels and development standards using machine learning clustering techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset is obtained from the SPSS (Statistical Project for Smart Students) 2024 competition by BINUS University, available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GK5WmUq0oWxRVmKCfJXrdbHFK9Szqjmd/view?usp=sharing). It includes detailed indicators for each district such as poverty percentages, average schooling years, per capita expenditure, Human Development Index (HDI), life expectancy, and employment rates among others.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this repository are to:
- Analyze various socioeconomic indicators across Indonesian districts.
- Apply clustering techniques to group districts with similar characteristics.
- Evaluate and interpret the clustering results to understand the different socioeconomic statuses across the regions.
